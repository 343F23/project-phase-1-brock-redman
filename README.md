# CS343-SemesterProject
CS-343 Front end web app project will be a personal finance app that will track saving, spending, and donations
as well as providing graphs for a visual representation for businesses and the public. The app contains pages
with an html table for viewing data and a visual page that allows them to view investment opportunities in the
form of creating graphs representing stock price points of certain companies.
